(Software Algorithm Product Identifying Components)

The algorithms software is engineered using this methodology, and our unique Company Operating Procedure certification benchmarks, is it certified or isn’t it, our al supports certified jewelry, appraisal certification, and the importance of getting it appraised, insurance recommendations, how important insurance is, seller credibility, what is their BBB rating, condition, is the item used or brand new, lab created or mineralogy resourced, warranty, how important a warranty is, repair & replace guidelines, return policy, the longevity of the return policy, product history, where did it come from, availability, is it in stock now or does the consumer have to order it, origin, which providence did it come from, how much is the value, using current market prices, how much is it worth, using supply and demand.  Our algorithm/methodology is updated every two weeks on loose diamonds, (rapaport), and every day on precious metals, (kitco).

Over 20 thousand vendors use the Rapaport for diamonds, so you have an idea, it’s like Kelly (Blue Book), however, in this case it determines the value for diamonds. The Official Rapaport established in 1976.  This report dictates the pricing, and estimates the current market value.  It represents hundreds of companies globally, including retailers, wholesalers, and appraisers.  The Rapaport get’s updated every second week of the month at 11:59 a.m on Thursday.

The software is engineered to search for jewelry stores, and the internet for the three top diamond recommendations.  Keep in mind, the algorithm will use the official Rapaport for it's pricing strategy.  It will visually show the consumer the percentage of the market price, and what percentage the consumer is paying for it.

The algorithms software is engineered using these key measurements, the table size, crown angle, star length, pavilion angle, lower girdle length, crown height, girdle thickness/girdle thinness, polished girdle/unpolished girdle, (brute/not bruted), total depth, and pavilion depth.  These measurements play a major role in product identification.

Crown Heights  - (AGA), 14.0% - 16.3%, (American Standard), 16.2%, (Eulitz Brilliant), 14.45%, (Ideal Brilliant), 14.2%, (Parker Brilliant), 10.5%, (Practical Fine Cut), 14.4%, (Scandinavian Standard), 14,6%, (MDG Brilliant), 14.1%.

Pavilion Depths - (AGA), 42.8%-43.2%, (American Standard), 43.1%, (Eulitz Brilliant), 43.15%, (Ideal Brilliant), 40%, (Parker Brilliant), 43.4%, (Practical Fine Cut), 43.2%, (Scandinavian Standard), 43.6%, (MDG Brilliant), 42.5%.

Table Diameters - (AGA), 53%-59%, (American Standard), 53%, (Eulitz  Brilliant), 56,5%, (Ideal Brilliant), 56.1%, (Parker Brilliant), 55.9%, (Practical Fine Cut), 56%, (Scandinavian Standard), 57.5%, (MDG Brilliant), 56%.

Crown Angles - (AGA), 34.0% - 34.7%, (American Standard), 34,5%, (Eulitz Brilliant), 33.6%, (Ideal Brilliant), 34.5%, (Parker Brilliant), 41.1%, (Practical Fine Cut), 25.5%, (Scandinavian Standard), 33.2%, (MDG Brilliant), 35%.

Pavilion Angles - (AGA), N/A, (American Standard), 40.75%, (Eulitz  Brilliant), 40.48%, (Ideal Brilliant), 40.75%, (Parker Brilliant), 38.7%, (Practical Fine Cut), 40.9%, (Scandinavian Standard), 40,8%, (MDG Brilliant), 40.5%.

Girdle Thickness - (AGA), N/A, (American Standard), N/A, (Eulitz Brilliant), 1.5%, (Ideal Brilliant), N/A, (Parker Brilliant), N/A, (Practical Fine Cut), N/A, (Scandinavian Standard), N/A, (MDG Brilliant), N/A.

Brilliance Grades - (AGA), 100%, (American Standard), 99.5%, (Eulitz Brilliant), 100%, (Ideal Brilliant), 99.5%, (Parker Brilliant), 98.4%, (Practical Fine Cut), 90.0%, (Scandinavian Standard), 99.5%, (MDG Brilliant), 100%.

(Color Grade System for all white diamonds)

Colorless, (D, E, F,) Near Colorless, (G, H, I,) Faint Color, (J, K, L,M,) Color, (N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z,).

(Clarity Grade System)

(F), Flawless, No Inclusions or Blemishes Under 10X Magnification, (IF), Small Blemishes Visible Under 10x Magnification, (VVS-1), 1 Very Very Slight Inclusion Extremely Difficult To See At 10X Magnification,  (VVS-2), 2 Very Very Sight Inclusions Very Difficult To See At 10X Magnification, (VS-1), 1 Very Slight Inclusion, Somewhat Difficult To See At 10X Magnification, (VS-2), 2 Very Slight Inclusions, Somewhat Easy To See With 10X Magnification, (SI-1), 1 Slight Inclusion, Noticeable ,Which, Is Easier To See With 10X Magnification, (SI-2), 2 Slight Inclusions, Noticeable Inclusions, Which,  Are Very Easy To See With 10X Magnification, (SI-3), 3 Slight Inclusions, Noticeable Inclusions, Which, Are Very Very Easy To See With 10x Magnification, (I-1), 1 Obvious Naked Eye Visible Inclusion, No Magnification Necessary, (I-2), 2 Naked Eye Inclusions, No Magnification Necessary, (I-3), 3 Naked Eye Inclusions, No Magnification Necessary. (I), Included Diamonds May Affect Transparency And Brilliance.

(Carat Weight - The Rapaport determines the value from 0.1 carats - 10.00 carat)

(Fluorescent Grading System)

Extremely Fluorescent, Fluorescent, Slight Fluorescence, Faint Fluorescence, Zero Fluorescence.
